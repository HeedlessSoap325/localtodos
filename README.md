# Local Todos

**Local Todos** is a privacy-focused todo manager built with **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, **IndexedDB**, and **Web Crypto**.  
It was created as a learning project to explore state management, encryption, and local storage in modern web apps.

## Features

- **Local & Encrypted Storage**  
  All todos are stored directly in the browser using IndexedDB and encrypted with the Web Crypto API.  
  Your data never leaves your device.

- **User Registration & Login**  
  - New users can register instantly.  
  - On first save, they are prompted to create a passphrase to secure their data.  
  - Existing users can log in, and won't be prompted to enter the passphrase on save again.

- **Projects & Organization**  
  - Create multiple **Projects** to separate areas of work or life.  
  - Inside each project, add **Todo Groups** or todos for structured task management.

- **Fast & Offline-First**  
  Everything works offline â€” no server, no syncing, no external dependencies.  
  Perfect for quick, private task management.
